## Chili

[[recipes]] #spicy #one-dish [[one-pan-dinner]]

### Ingredients

- 1 pound ground beef
- 1/2 cup chopped onion
- 1/2 cup chopped bell pepper
- 1 can black beans, drained and rinsed
- 1 can diced tomatoes
- 1 can tomato sauce (or you can use tomato paste and water)
- Water as desired

You can decide how thick you want your chili to be. I would add a minimum of 1 cup of water, but whatever you want is fine as long as it is liquid.

### Seasonings

- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
- 1/2 tsp onion powder
- 1tsp red pepper flakes
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp oregano
- 1/2 tsp dried basil
- 1/4 tsp black pepper
- 1/2 tsp salt

You can adjust seasonings to your taste. The above will give you a medium amount of heat for someone used to spicy foods. My oregano and garlic powder are usually heaping 1/2 teaspoonfuls. It's just a matter of preference.

### How to Make Chili

Before starting, I like to measure out my seasonings and put them in a small bowl. I also gather my ingredients so they are handy. These are both **optional** of course, but it makes cooking less stressful and more fun!

1. Brown ground beef on **medium** in a deep skillet or a Dutch oven. I like to add a nice pinch of sea salt to the meat as it is cooking.
2. Chop up onion and pepper, add to meat when it is almost done cooking. **cook for additional 5 minutes, stirring occasionally**
3. While the veggies are cooking in the meat, I open my cans and drain the beans. I also rinse the beans well. (draining the beans is optional)
4. Add the beans, tomatoes and tomato sauce, mix together.
5. Add seasonings and stir in.
6. Bring mixture to a slow boil.
7. Reduce heat to **Low** and **cover**
8. Cook for 20 minutes or more, turn off heat and let sit covered for 10 minutes.
9. Stir and **Serve** with crackers or [[garlic bread]]

### Serving Suggestions

You can add condiments to your chili like sour cream or shredded cheese.
